# jackson-utils-simple

**Owner(s):** Carlos Devoto

A lightweight library containing useful utility classes to be used in conjunction with the Jackson serialization framework. In particular, this library contains an ``ObjectMappers`` factory class that should be used to standardize the creation and configuration of ``ObjectMapper`` instances across our codebase.
