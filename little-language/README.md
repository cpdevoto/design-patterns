# little-language
A collection of projects, each representing use of the Little Language design pattern in order to implement a different grammar, with different sets of desired outputs:

1. *compiler - three-address code:* shows how to parse a C-like language in order to generate three-address intermediate code (very similar to assembly language).
2. *little language - die roll expression language:* a little language used to express different different combinations of dice that you would like to roll. For instance, the expression "4d6 DL 1" means roll 4 six-sided dice and drop the lowest result.
3. *little language - json parser:* a fully functional JSON parser created using the little language design pattern.
4. *little language - simple search expression language*: a little language used to express simple string seach patterns such as "fox and not(brown or black)"
