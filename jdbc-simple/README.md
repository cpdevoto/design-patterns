# jdbc-simple

**Owner(s):** Carlos Devoto

A lightweight library create to eliminate a lot of the boilerplate code involved with coding JDBC logic.  For more details, see the docs/JdbcStatementFactory.pptx Powerpoint presentation file. 

**NOTE:** The classes contained in this library mirror the ones contained in the resolute-utils subproject of the resolute-common-utils project. I decided to copy these classes into their own library so that they could be used without pulling in a bunch of superfluous transitive dependencies.
