Port Nyanzaru Encounter Details
1,A parrot poops on a random character’s head.
2,Near the harbor, an ankylosaurus that tows boats through the warehouse canals goes on a rampage and must be calmed, restrained, or killed.
3,A merchant shouts, “Stop! Thief!” as a furtive youngster (commoner) rushes past the characters. If the thief is caught, the grateful merchant can introduce characters to a merchant prince or provide them one other favor.
4,A drunk foreign sailor (unarmored veteran) is loudly trying to pick a fight with three local commoners, who are clearly no match for the lout. If the characters intervene, the grateful locals become a reliable source of information about Port Nyanzaru, but the sailor and his shipmates ambush the characters elsewhere in the city later on.
5,A beggar (commoner) grabs a character by the arm and shouts, “The ancient one beneath the Forbidden City gives birth to a terrible new god! The snake-men know! They know!” Then he stumbles away into the crowd. Passersby tell the adventurers to ignore the beggar, and that his predictions are wrong most of the time.
6,Alarm horns declare that undead are attacking Malar’s Throat. Mercenaries keep the monsters out of the city proper, but people are trapped in the temple of Tymora and besieged by 2d6 zombies and 2d6 skeletons led by a ghoul. If the characters defeat the undead, the temple rewards them with 5 gallons of tej and a potion of healing.
7,Shouts of “Look out!” give a character a brief warning as a water barrel, building stone, or other heavy weight crashes down. The character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be struck, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a disguised yuan-ti pureblood slinking away from the scene.
8,A tabaxi minstrel (see appendix D) asks one of the characters for a gold piece to stake her for gambling, promising to pay it back. If the character agrees, the tabaxi makes good on her promise the next day, returning a pouch containing 10 gp.
9,A thief (spy) tries to pick the pocket of one of the characters.
10,The characters run into Volothamp "Volo" Geddarm (see appendix D), who is delivering a copy of his new book to one of the city’s merchant princes. There is a 50 percent chance that Volo is drunk.
