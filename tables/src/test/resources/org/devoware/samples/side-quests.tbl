Side Quests
1,Collect a Debt. K’lahu (N female Chultan human thug), a bookie who takes bets at Executioner’s Run (see area 2), asks the adventurers to come with her as she collects a debt. The pay is 10 percent of whatever is collected on the 500 gp debt, which is owed by a man named Taban (N male Chultan human gladiator). Taban refuses to pay anything until he’s beaten down to 20 or fewer hit points, whereupon he offers up a pouch containing ten 50 gp gemstones. Ashamed by his defeat and eager to redeem himself, Taban offers to join the party as a follower, demanding no pay for the duration of the adventure.
2,Create a Distraction at Fort Beluarian. Rokah (N male Chultan human spy) works for the Zhentarim. The Zhents believe that pirates have formed an alliance with the Flaming Fist. Rokah has orders to infiltrate Fort Beluarian and find proof so that the Zhentarim can blackmail the fort’s commander. He asks the adventurers to escort him safely to the fort and create a distraction so that he can ransack the commander’s quarters. As a reward, Rokah offers to cover the cost of a charter of exploration (50 gp), which the characters will almost certainly need if they want to avoid future confrontations with the Flaming Fist. Rokah also offers to introduce the characters to two wilderness guides — a pair tabaxi siblings named River Mist and Flask of Wine (see “Finding a Guide”) — and pay the guides’ fees.
3,Escort a Priest to Camp Vengeance. Undril Silvertusk (LG female half-orc priest of Torm with darkvision out to a range of 60 feet) is a representative of the Order of the Gauntlet and newly arrived in Port Nyanzaru. She needs to deliver herself plus a packet of dispatches from her superiors to Commander Niles Breakbone at Camp Vengeance. Undril was led to believe she could simply buy a horse in the city and ride to the camp, but now that she sees the terrain and conditions, that’s clearly not possible. She hopes to join any expedition headed up the River Soshenstar. Undril is quite attached to her chain shirt, but she’s not unreasonable when presented with good arguments for shedding the armor. If characters gain Undril’s respect, she’ll intercede strongly on their behalf if any difficulties arise with Commander Breakbone (as they’re likely to, as discussed in chapter 2).
4,Explore the Aldani Basin. Inete (LG female Chultan human acolyte of Savras) has had disturbing visions of red-robed wizards operating a secret base somewhere in the Aldani Basin. The head of her temple, Grandfather Zitembe, has too many other things on his mind, but he’s given Inete permission to investigate. Inete would like to accompany the characters’ expedition for safety, if characters are heading toward or through that region. She’ll provide her own food and supplies, and “donate” another 100 gp to the expedition’s expenses. She insists on stopping by the temple of Savras to gather her belongings and urges the characters to come along. If they do, the characters can meet Grandfather Zitembe (see area 7).
5,Find Artus Cimber. A half-elf named Xandala (see appendix D) approaches the characters and claims to be Artus Cimber’s daughter. Feigning worry, she asks the characters to help her find him. Artus can’t be found using magic, but Xandala has heard that Artus left the city with a reptilian man who doesn’t talk and smells funny. Both were last seen heading into the jungle. Xandala wants the Ring of Winter in Artus’s possession, but she doesn’t share this with the characters. Summerwise, Xandala’s pet pseudodragon, thinks the quest for the ring is too dangerous but has given up trying to talk sense into its mistress. Good-aligned characters might be able to turn Summerwise against Xandala, or at least get information from it that they can use to thwart Xandala’s plan or to aid Artus.
6,Help a Dyeing Man. Omala (N male Chultan human commoner) is a master colorist at the dye works (area 23). He recently bought some dancing monkey fruit on the black market and used them to make and sell dye. Shortly thereafter, he received an iron token from the Ytepka Society — a grim warning. He wishes to atone for his crime and seeks an audience with Kwayothé, the merchant prince who controls the legal sale of fruit. Fearing for his life, Omala asks the adventurers to accompany him to Goldenthrone (see area 4), where he plans to beg for Kwayothé’s forgiveness. He has no money to offer the characters as a reward. Kwayothé is willing to forgive Omala’s lapse in judgment provided the characters agree to kill a man named Shago within the next 10 days — no questions asked — and speak of the deed to no one. Kwayothé tells them that Shago works as a guide out of Fort Beluarian. If the characters fail in this task, Kwayothé has Omala sentenced to Executioner’s Run (see area 2) for his crime.
7,Help the Lords’ Alliance. Lerek Dashlynd (LN male Illuskan human spy), an agent of the Lords’ Alliance, offers to trade a sailing ship for an accurate map of Chult that shows the exact location of the ruins of Nangalore and Orolunga. Lerek represents wealthy Waterdhavian interests, and the offer is genuine. If the characters present such a map, Lerek has a cleric cast augury before agreeing to buy it, to make sure he’s not buying a fake. Once he’s convinced that the map is genuine, Lerek arranges to have the promised ship arrive in 10 days.
8,Hunt Pirates. The harbormaster, Zindar (see area 13 and appendix D), is a secret member of the Ytepka Society. He knows that three pirate captains are attacking merchant ships heading to and from the Bay of Chult. The pirate ships are called the Dragonfang, the Emerald Eye, and the Stirge. Zindar has permission from the merchant princes to offer a bounty of 2,000 gp for each pirate ship that is captured and brought into port, and a bonus 500 gp for the capture of each pirate captain.
9,Save an Innocent Man. Belym (LG male Chultan human commoner) is distraught because his husband, Draza (LG male Chultan commoner), has been sentenced to Executioner’s Run for stealing. Belym asserts that his husband was a victim of mistaken identity and sentenced without a proper hearing or trial. He’s been unable to persuade anyone in authority that Draza is innocent. He’ll give the characters 25 sp (all his savings) if they can help Draza from the sidelines so he survives the run. Draza is about to be thrown into the pit with a pair of velociraptors, so the characters must act quickly. Both the authorities and the gamblers take a dim view of interference.
10,Seek Wisdom at Orolunga. Eshek (NG male Chultan human acolyte of Savras) stumbles up to the characters in the street and whispers, “Speak to the wise guardian of Orolunga, east of Mbala. She can direct you to that which you seek.” Then he collapses, unconscious. When he awakens moments later, Eshek has no memory of the last 12 hours aside from a driving need to find people matching the characters’ descriptions. He’s as puzzled by what just happened as the characters probably are, but he’ll help them however he can. At the very least, he knows where Mbala is from speaking to porters who’ve been to Camp Vengeance.
