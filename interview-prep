# Preparation Materials

## 1. Algorithms

For you, there will be 2 rounds of algorithmic problems. Each round is 45 minutes.
The introduction and wrapping up will take about 5 minutes. So the net coding time
is 35 minutes. You will not have IDE, but only a notepad. 

You will have a medium, or an easy + medium problems like the problems on this site.

https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/

I would suggest you to prioritize the first 500 problems (skip hard, focus on medium)

This section will take the most of your preparation time, if not all.

## 2. System Design

Spend 10% of your prepration time on this section.

For you, there will be 2 rounds of System Design. Which I think you are going to win
easily. Try to watch some videos of this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWO07iEpjO4
I think his tutorial is too detailed, but the knowledge I learnt there helps with or
without interviews.

I used https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design

There is a paid version as well (I don't think you need it as it's too detailed. You will not get the bang of the bucks)

## 3. Behaviorial Questions

I think your improvision answer will already win you through. So no preparation is needed.
