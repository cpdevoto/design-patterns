# homonculus-logging

**Owner(s):** Carlos Devoto

The **homonculus-logging** library adds functionality to the homonculus framework to allow for the automatic configuration of the underlying logging library (logback over slf4j) based on YAML settings included within the main configuration file for the application you are building.
